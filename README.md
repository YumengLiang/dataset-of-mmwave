# dataset-of-mmwave
This is the mmWave sensing dataset of different tasks, including liquid identification, blood pressure monitoring... 

1. Dataset of FG-liquID


    It's the 3000 samples dataset of 30 kinds of liquids for mmwave-based liquid identification, which is proposed in our IMWUT 2021 paper 《FG-LiquID: A Contact-less  Fine-grained Liquid Identifier by Pushing the Limits of Millimeter-wave Sensing》 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478075

   The code is available at : https://github.com/YumengLiang/FG-LiquID 
   
    Usage: You can unzip the zip file, and replace files in ./data/ 
    
2. Dataset of blood pressure

    It's the 15 blood pressure samples dataset of 5 different subjects. Each sample contains 6300*1 length data, which is recorded mmWave sensing data of the wrist artery by 210 Hz. The groundtruth contains (data_path | SBP | DBP | HeatRate | Gender) labels.  Our paper is still under review, thus we only public part of our dataset.
