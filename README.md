# dataset-of-mmwave
This is the mmWave sensing dataset of different tasks, including liquid identification, blood pressure monitoring... 

1. Dataset of FG-liquID


    It's the 3000 samples dataset of 30 kinds of liquids for mmwave-based liquid identification, which is proposed in our IMWUT 2021 paper 《FG-LiquID: A Contact-less  Fine-grained Liquid Identifier by Pushing the Limits of Millimeter-wave Sensing》 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478075
